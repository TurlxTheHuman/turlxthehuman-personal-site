My [personal website](https://turlxthehuman.com) that is built using [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) just to be used as a small portfolio/landing page so people can access my links. 

You can view the site [here](https://turlxthehuman.com)

## Setup

1) Install Needed Dependencies (Debian)

```shell
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm git
```

2) Clone Github Repository (Personally Put All Websites In /var/www/ But You Do You) & CD into Directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TurlxTheHuman/turlxthehuman-personal-site

```

3) Install all needed packages

I will create a dockerfile or system file later, I use other things to host my sites.
